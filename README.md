**Clustering is an unsupervised learning technique that identifies natural groupings in data without predefined labels.**

# Industrial Sensors Clustering
This notebook project applies **unsupervised machine learning (clustering)** to an industrial sensor dataset.  
By using **KMeans** and evaluating with the **silhouette score**, the notebook demonstrates how sensor data can be grouped into clusters that reveal hidden operational patterns or anomalies.

# Technologies Used
- Python 3.x  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- scikit-learn  
- Matplotlib
